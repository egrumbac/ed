# The Young Lords
### A BRIEF INTRODUCTION

In 1898. the United States declared war on Spain and, as' victor of the war', took Puerto Rico as a possession - beginm'ng the colonial relationship that persists to the present day. And since the formation of that bcolonial relationship" there has been a steady immigration of Pueno Ricans to the United States. The trend of migration has been largely shaped in the past by periods ofwar. In 1917 US Congress passed the Jones Act, which made the Puerto Rican people US citiz'ens. This' was done mostly for the need of people to fight tn' WWI. Sm'ce they were now citiz'ens Puetto Rican men were drafted into the Arms Service to fight and die dunn'g WWI. By 1930 there were many established Puato Rican communities all over the country, most notably in New Yorkbs Harlem and the Borough ofBrooklyn.

As a source of cheap labor us companies were looking towards Puerto Rico again by WWII. The averageyearly migration ofPueno Ricans from 1.800 between 1930 and 1940 to 31,000 from 1946 to 1950. and to 45,000 from l95l to 1960. In 1953. Pucrto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75.000 people left the island. By 1964. the Puerto Rican commum'ty made up 9.3 pacent of the total New York City population.

Within the United States, Puerto Ricans also settled in many other urban areas such as New Haven, Hartford. Boston, Jersey City, Philadelphia and Chicago. In Clu'cago these early nu'grmts lrve'd in van'ous neighborhoods, includtn'ngWlw, theNear
and the Wb By the 19605most Chicago Puerto Ricans were concentrated in' Linmln Parkm, andflummmm and shared these neighborhoods with mm and Ethh'unrm'grants as well as In Lincoln Park, Pucrto Rican residents established a small, ethnic enclave along Amuta'ge Avenue that included small mm and busrn'esses providm'g goods and services for Pueno Rican neighbors. The conditions faced wae deplorable and poverty was rampant. Puerto Ricans in the Um'ted States fought against discrrmm"ation and econcrnic exploitation. As the numbers grewin the 1950s. they were increasingly portrayed as unwilling to work; welfare leeches. drug addicts andjuvenile delrn'quents. And by the mid-19605. however. Puerto Rican and other low-income resrd'ents of Lincoln Park were displaced by LLran MW programs and the redevelopment of Lincoln Park. It was a consequence of the poor public view of the Puerto Rican community that allowed business and government leaders to get away with policies and practices that exploited and demeaned Puerto Ricans injobs, housing, and education. Due to the burban renewal" programs Pueno Rican residents relocated to WestTown and Humboldt lbark. where their' concentration facrlbitated the creation of Chicago's ftrsbt Puemo Ricanbam'o. or neighborhood, along Division Street, or, as resrd'ents frequently refer to it. In Drv'u'ion.

For Puertc Ricans in' Chicago, Division Streetplays a prominent role in the history of the developmentof therr' community. It was dunn'g this' first Puerto Rican Parade on June 12. 1966. that one ofthe first Puerto Rican riots in' the US. began. on DivisionStreet. The not, one of many urban disturbances across the nation in the 19603. was a response to the shoottn'g of a young Puerto Rican man by Chimgopghm'. Riotmg' conu'nued untilb June 14. A key moment tn' the history of Puerto Ric'ans in Chicago, the Division Sueet nbot drew attention to poverty and to strain'ed relations between Puerto Ricans and Gu'eago's police department.
Tire'd of seein'g therr' people oppre$ed and suffering. the Young Lords Party emerged as a response to the rampant racrs'm and poverty that Puerto Ritbans living in the US had to endure. Although founded by Pueno Rican people, the Young Lords fought for the fights of 411 under-privileged people in the United States. Originablly a product oftlx: mid 1960's revolutionary atmosphere. the Young Lords came into bein'g at a time when Puerto Rican peOplc were treated as sub-human
There are very few concrete answers on who organrz'ed the Young Lords. This main'ly has to do with the diff'erent chapters (notably Chicago and New York) comm'g up at around the same ttrn'e. It is widely believed that the politicizing of the Chicago Young Lords has a lot to do with Jose "Cha Cha" Jun'ena meeting Fred Hampton and other Black Panther Pany members while in pnbson.They discussed the exploitation and oppression of Latinbo/as, African AmericanS' and poor people in" the United Stats. They took thtsb relau'onshiop as far as becomrn'gco-founders of the 1960's Rainbow Coalition, which m'cluded the B lack Panthers. the organiz'ation that sought self-deta'rru'natio'n for African descended people. and the Young Patriots. 8 gang of wlubte youths who turned toward pr_oaressive politics. Cha Cha took what he learned from people like Fred Hampton to the Young Lords. and helped transform them in'to an organimtion committed' to human rights and the liberation of Puerto Rico.
The New York chapteris believed to have been formed by Pumo Rican College Students tn' January of 1969. A group of students decided something had to be done to unite the Puerto Ricans mb the ghetto with the ones in the schools. These students therefore set up the Sociedad de Albizu Carn'pos (SAC). When the Rainb'ow the Coalition sent representatives to the annual Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) convention they met Joe Martinez. a member of the SDS in Florida. He met with some of the founders of the Young Lords Orgaruz'ation (YLO) and told them that he was going to move to New York, inb which he wished for pemus'sion to start a YLO chapter.
When Joe Marun'ez first arn'ved in New York. he had a drum, mud) likethat of the SAC. He soon started a group that met regularly in the Lower East Side. This' group later heard of another group that believed 1n' much ofthe same ideas that they did'. During the late even in'g, this group, led by an individual name Pickle, would clean up the streets ole-l Barrio and leave the garbage in the rm'ddle of the street tn' the mortun'g so the Sanitation Department would have to clean it up in order to allow traffic to pass through. Martinez later met Pickle, and formed another alliance. The SAC had also hard about the Young Lords Orgaru'mtion in' Chicago. and about the newly atablished merger of the groups in New York. The SAC met with the group that had just been merged and soonbecame a pan of it, fomnn'gone ofthe strongestrevolutionary groups inNew York City. On July 26, 1969. thecoalition formedinNew York was soon recogniz'ed by Chicago as the New York State Chapter of the YoungLords Organizat'ion.
The New York Chapter:
The Young Lords set up community programs: free breakfast for children, commuru'ty testin'g for tuberculosis and lead pors'omngb. free clothing dn'ves, cultural events and Puerto Ric'an hrs'tory classes.
TheYoung Lords addressedissues concerning pns'oners, women, the workmbg poor. Vietnam War veterans and hiahvschool students. Theysummariz'ed theirb politiml beliefs and goalsin a 13 point program. published and distributed a newspapercalled PALANTEand produced a weekly radio' showon WBAI alsocalled PALANTE.
In late 1969, the Young Lords took over a church in' El Bam'o (Spm'sh Harlem) that had refused use of its available space for a breakfast program for neighborhood children. The Young Lords renamed it the "People's Church," and it became a symbol of the fight for socral'justtc'e by Puerto Ric'an people in the United S tates.
